                        >reactor pattern</a
                    >, is a design pattern for handling multiple requests
                    concurrently in which there is a single event loop that
                    monitors multiple file descriptors (opening connection that
                    represents a request), and there is a thread pool to handle
                    and process requests.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The single event loop uses
                    <rx-inline-code>epoll</rx-inline-code> to monitor file
                    descriptors and demultiplex events to the appropriate
                    handler, or in this case, the thread pool. The event loop
                    will monitor <em>three</em> states of the file descriptor:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <rx-inline-code>EPOLLIN</rx-inline-code> &mdash; Clients
                        want to send requests
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <rx-inline-code>EPOLLOUT</rx-inline-code> &mdash; Server
                        wants to send response
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <rx-inline-code>EPOLLERR</rx-inline-code> &mdash; Errors
                        happen during processing
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The thread pool spawns a number of threads (POSIX
                    <rx-inline-code>pthread</rx-inline-code>) at the
                    initialization of the server (when the server is booting).
                    Each thread will be listening to a bounded buffer for a
                    task. When a task is available, the thread will pop the task
                    from the buffer and process it. After processing, the thread
                    will notify the event loop and go back listening.

                    Linux <rx-inline-code>epoll</rx-inline-code> is a scalable
                    I/O event notification mechanism that is efficient at
                    monitoring a large number of files descriptors. Therefore,
                    the server can quickly tell which files descriptors are
                    ready for reading or writing. However, the event loop needs
                    to be kept non-blocking.

                    A thread pool, on the other hand, is a collection of threads
                    whose responsibility is fulfill requests assigned to it.
                    Since processing requests can be blocking (e.g. reading from
                    an HTML file like this page), each task is consumd by a
                    thread to avoid blocking the event loop.

            <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold">How does it work?</h3>
            <div class="flex flex-col justify-center gap-3">
                <p>
                    The server itself is a passive TCP socket that listens for a
                    new connection. It also maintains a list of active
                    connections using
                    <rx-inline-code>epoll</rx-inline-code>. When a new
                    connection is connected successfully, its file descriptor
                    will be added to the epoll instance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The event loop will monitor the epoll instance for new
                    events. If the event is from the server socket, it means
                    that there is a new connection. If the event is from active
                    client sockets, it means that there are some data to be read
                    from, or written to, the client. It can be also an error
                    happening during processing (either from the client or from
                    the server).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Every socket in the event loop is set to non-blocking mode,
                    which means operations like
                    <rx-inline-code>read</rx-inline-code> and
                    <rx-inline-code>write</rx-inline-code> will not block the
                    server, and return immediately (either with data or error).
                    By doing so, the event loop can quickly tell which sockets
                    are ready for reading or writing. However, it also requires
                    some mechanisms to handle the incomplete data. This is done
                    by maintaining a <strong>temporary buffer</strong> for each
                    connection.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Initially, newly-connected clients are set to read mode
                    (<rx-inline-code>EPOLLIN</rx-inline-code>). After reading a
                    request completely, the event loop will pass the request to
                    the thread pool for processing.
                </p>

                    Thread pools are designed with a bounded buffer (<a
                        is="rx-link"

                        >Producer-consumer problem</a
                    >). The buffer is a ring buffer that is shared among all the
                    threads. When there is an available task from the buffer, a
                    thread will pop that task and process it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Concurrency problem is handled by using two
                    <strong>semaphores</strong> and one
                    <strong>mutex</strong> lock. The first semaphore is used (by
                    the main thread / event loop) to signal (worker threads)
                    that there is at least one task available in the buffer. The
                    second semaphore is used (by worker threads) to signal (main
                    thread / event loop) that there is at least one slot
                    available for new tasks in the buffer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After processing the request, the thread will construct an
                    appropriate response and submit it back to the event loop by
                    setting the event to write mode
                    (<rx-inline-code>EPOLLOUT</rx-inline-code>). The event loop
                    will then write the response to the client socket.
